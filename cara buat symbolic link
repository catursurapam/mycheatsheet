when i opening this https://pilar.asia/storage/app/pdfs/testing.pdf

404 not found


Let's troubleshoot the storage access issue. The file path in the URL suggests you're trying to access /storage/app/pdfs/testing.pdf, but with the Laravel storage setup, you should be able to access it simply as /storage/pdfs/testing.pdf.

Let's fix this:

First, check your file location:
bash

Copy
# Check if file exists in the correct location
ls /home/pilarasi/pilarasia-v2/storage/app/public/pdfs/testing.pdf
Ensure the symbolic link is correctly set up:
bash

Copy
# Remove existing storage link in public_html if any
rm -rf /home/pilarasi/public_html/storage

# Create new symbolic link
ln -s /home/pilarasi/pilarasia-v2/storage/app/public /home/pilarasi/public_html/storage
Check permissions:
bash

Copy
# Set correct permissions
chmod 755 /home/pilarasi/public_html/storage
chmod 644 /home/pilarasi/pilarasia-v2/storage/app/public/pdfs/testing.pdf
After doing this, you should be able to access your file at:


Copy
https://pilar.asia/storage/pdfs/testing.pdf
If still not working, verify:

The file is actually in the public storage directory
The symbolic link is correctly created
All directories have proper permissions
The web server has read access to the file
You can check the symbolic link with:

bash

Copy
ls -l /home/pilarasi/public_html/storage
